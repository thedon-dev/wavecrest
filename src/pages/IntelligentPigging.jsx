          At the forefront of our pipeline solutions lies our intelligent
          pigging technology. These intelligent “pigs” are essentially
          sophisticated in-line inspection tools propelled through your
          pipeline. Packed with an array of sensors, these tools gather critical
          data on the pipeline’s internal health, identifying potential issues
          like corrosion, cracks, dents, and deformations. This proactive
          approach allows you to:
